ruote-amqp-pyclient (1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Merge in the 'register' feature (although this is going away)
  * Allow 'variables' to be passed to ruote
  * Tiny improvement to workitem resilience - still sucks
  * Add a finish() method that causes the run() to exit next time a
    message is received (unused, untested)
  * Use the new position option to play nice with ruote-kit's catch all participant
